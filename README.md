# Differentiable Digital Signal Processing

Implementation of the [DDSP model](https://github.com/magenta/ddsp) using PyTorch.
Forked from [Artificial Creative Intelligence and Data Science](https://github.com/acids-ircam/ddsp_pytorch). 

Current additions to forked code include: encoders, decoders and a ResNet autoencoder. 

Current development: *very* Experimental autoencoder for unsupervized pitch detection (ConvLSTM).

Potential next steps: creating a synthetic data pipeline for self-supervised feature extraction; adding more autoencoders for unsupervised/semi-supervised synthesis.
